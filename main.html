    <h1>Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
    <p>Time complexity is a crucial concept in computer science that measures the efficiency of an algorithm in terms of the number of operations it performs relative to input size. An efficient algorithm runs in minimal time, ensuring optimal performance.</p>
    <p><b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm requires in relation to its input size. For instance, an algorithm with a space requirement of O(n) uses memory proportional to the input size, which can impact overall system performance.</p>
